// usage_records: the yearly window covered the whole table, so every proxied
// request rescanned the entire usage history, and adding gateway replicas only
// added concurrent scans of the same rows.
//
// One row is written per (scope, scope id, org, currency, day) as usage is
// recorded, in the same transaction as the usage record itself. A daily budget
// then reads one row, a monthly one at most 31 and a yearly one at most 366,
// whatever the size of usage_records.
//
// Only PAYG usage is counted: subscription-covered records do not consume a
// monetary budget and are governed by the subscription enforcer instead.

	// application's spend likewise stays partitioned by organization.

	// SQLite and PostgreSQL, and so the bucket is computed once, in Go, in the
	// same timezone the budget windows use.

// distinct principals: the shadow user has no budget of its own, while the
// application does. Counting application spending on the shadow user's
// counter would silently bypass any budget the operator set on the
// application (see issue #64); counting user spending on the application
// counter would inflate a per-application budget with activity unrelated to
// it. A record that feeds no monetary budget yields no row, per
// model.FeedsMonetaryBudget, the rule the backfill restates in SQL.
